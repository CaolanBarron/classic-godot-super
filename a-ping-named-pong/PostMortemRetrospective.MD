## What went well:

- Dialogue system does'nt seem too difficult
- The basic animations I did were pretty cool and quick to make

## Things to do better next time:

- Dont jump straight into complexity when its not needed. I could have probably made the game without proper state machines. With a big game state machines would be useful but not for a small project like this.
- PLAN AHEAD even on a small game like this i should have been writing down ideas and game mechanics for the platforming section and things like that
