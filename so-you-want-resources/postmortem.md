# What went well

- The original asteroids was mimicked very well

# What didn't go well

- The optional game mode doesn't feel good to play
- Should have come up with a MVP much quicker
- If i am going to make a separate side mode I should just start from scratch. I will be able to catch up quickly and avoid any awkwardness
